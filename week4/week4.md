# Week 4 — Object Tracking 

## Overview
Week 4 focused on extending object detection to video-based analysis through object tracking and object detection. Using the trained YOLOv5 pedestrian detector from the previous week, a tracking-by-detection pipeline was implemented to follow individuals across video frames. This week emphasized understanding motion patterns.

## Topics Covered

### Object Tracking Fundamentals
- Object tracking involves assigning a unique identity to detected objects and maintaining that identity across consecutive frames.
- Tracking builds on object detection by incorporating temporal information from videos.
- Tracking-by-detection pipelines rely on a detector to provide bounding boxes and a tracker to associate detections over time.
- Common challenges include occlusions, missed detections, and identity switches.

### Tracking Implementation
- YOLOv5 was used as the object detector to identify pedestrians in each video frame.
- DeepSORT was employed as the tracking algorithm to assign and maintain object IDs.
- Kalman filtering and data association techniques were used internally by the tracker to handle motion prediction and matching.
- Trajectories were generated by storing the center points of bounding boxes for each tracked object.

### Motion Analysis
- Tracking enabled analysis of pedestrian movement over time.
- Motion trajectories provided information about speed, direction, and movement patterns.
- These trajectories formed the basis for behavior analysis and anomaly detection.


## Assignments / Work Done
- Implemented object tracking using YOLOv5 and DeepSORT.
- Stored and visualized object trajectories across video frames.

## Key Learnings
- Object tracking enables temporal understanding beyond frame-wise detection.
- Tracking-by-detection is an effective approach for multi-object tracking tasks.
- Motion trajectories provide valuable information for behavior analysis.


## Conclusion & Final Outcome
Week 4 completed the transition from object detection to full video-based analysis. The final system integrates detection, tracking.
